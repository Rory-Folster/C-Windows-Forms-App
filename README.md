# C-Windows-Forms-App
this app is bundled with the two necessary files, in the Debug folder. The app uses a text file and displays the entries inside on the main form, you can also edit or delete these entries. Additionally, you can create new entries with Costs if needed.

This was created for my SDV601 class. The main objectives of the class was Object Orientated programming and the different fundementals(polymorphism, etc).
